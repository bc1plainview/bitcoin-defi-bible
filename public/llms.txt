## About This Site

The Bitcoin DeFi Bible (defibible.org) is a comprehensive guide to native Bitcoin DeFi powered by OP_NET — smart contracts on Bitcoin Layer 1 without bridges, wrapped tokens, or L2s. It covers DeFi mechanics (AMMs, yield farming, staking), Bitcoin-native trading via NativeSwap, and how to deploy tokens and yield farms on Bitcoin.

## Key Concepts

- **SlowFi**: DeFi mechanism where structural exit friction (slow blocks, high fees) keeps capital in protocols longer, enabling sustainable growth
- **OP_NET**: Consensus protocol enabling smart contracts on Bitcoin Layer 1 via Tapscript-encoded calldata. Not a chain, not an L2, not a sidechain.
- **NativeSwap**: Bitcoin-native AMM with P2P BTC settlement and two-phase commit
- **Motoswap**: First DEX on Bitcoin L1 — AMM pools, yield farming, token launches
- **MotoChef**: MasterChef-style yield farming engine on Bitcoin
- **Proof of HODL**: Non-custodial BTC staking using UTXO tracking — earn yield without locking BTC
- **OP-20**: Fungible token standard on Bitcoin (like ERC-20 on Ethereum)
- **OP-20S**: Stablecoin extension for OP-20 with peg-aware AMM pricing
- **$MOTO**: Revenue-sharing token — stakers earn fees from all Motoswap swaps
